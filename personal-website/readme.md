# Build a Website using HTML/CSS Lab


###Description

Create two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](starter-code/images) with descriptions of the work you've done for the companies mentioned above. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--we've provided you with [some sample copy](starter-code/sample-copy.txt) that you can use.


#### Requirements

- Link both pages together using `a` tag
- Use a unique `title` and a single unique `h1` tag
- Show images using `img` tags including unique `alt` attributes
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your pages
- Select at least 5 elements on the page and apply at least 5 different css properties (`font-size`, `color`, `font-family`, `background`, `text-decoration`) to these elements
- Use at least 6 different HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `a`, `img`) on your pages
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

**Bonus**:

- Experiment by adding additional HTML tags and CSS properties we did not cover in class - explore!



#### Starter code

There is **no starter code** for this assignment (only [starter text](starter-code/sample-copy.txt)). You're going to build this assignment from scratch and should feel free to get creative with regard to layout, color, styling, etc.
